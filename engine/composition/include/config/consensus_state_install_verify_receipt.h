 * consensus_state_install_verify_receipt.h — durable "this exact immutable
 * bundle already passed the deterministic content-verify pass under this
 * exact verifying binary" receipt.
 *
 * The full content verify (config/consensus_state_bundle_validate.c's
 * validate_coins/validate_anchors/validate_nullifiers deep scans, plus the
 * whole-file PRAGMA integrity_check) is a pure function of two inputs: the
 * bundle's exact bytes (bundle_sha3_256) and the exact verifying code that
 * runs it (the verifier's build-epoch digest, see
 * consensus_state_producer_receipt_current_binary_epoch()). Given identical
 * inputs the deterministic scan always reproduces the identical verdict, so a
 * receipt that pins both keys durably lets a later admission attempt on the
 * same unchanged artifact skip re-running the O(bundle-size) scan.
 *
 * This receipt is content-verification authority ONLY. It never substitutes
 * for, weakens, or is consulted by the publication CAS / selected-chain
 * binding / activation admission decision — those always re-run in full on
 * every attempt. Losing or never having a receipt only costs a slower
 * re-verify, never a correctness or authority gap: lookup fails soft (missing
 * file, wrong key, or a corrupt/unreadable store are all "no receipt, verify
 * in full"), and store() is best-effort (a write failure only costs a future
 * re-verify, never the just-completed ADMIT/VERIFIED decision it followed).
 *
 * One receipt file per datadir (this seam is only ever consulted for the ONE
 * bundle currently being admitted/activated there); a receipt for a different
 * bundle hash or a different verifier epoch is simply not a match and is
 * treated as absent.
